                                                                                                                    2. Answer: The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) has capabilities of self-renewal, and helps give rise to progenitor cells that will create the sequence of blood cell maturation. The main difference between the HSC and the progenitors is their outcomes. The HSC has the capability to give rise to any of the blood cell lineages, whereas the progenitors are more restricted in their ability to produce different types of blood cells. The two types of cell are morphologically indistinguishable.

                                                                                                                       5. Juxtacrine signaling: The cytokine remains membrane-bound, which requires interaction between membrane and membrane receptors to achieve the desired effect. Example: stem cells and SCF or FL.
                                                                                                                       6. (Objective 5, Level I)
                                                                                                                       7. 3. Explain the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and describe how it can contribute to disease.
                                                                                                                          4. Answer: JAK: Janus family PTKs (protein tyrosine kinases) interact with the STAT transcription factors (signal transducers and activators of transcription). Once STAT proteins are phosphorylated by activated JAK kinases, they dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, bind to cytokine-specific DNA sequences, and activate (or inhibit) specific gene expression. Abnormalities in this pathway have been shown to cause polycythemia vera and other myeloproliferative disorders.

                                                                                                                          6. 4. Explain the role of stromal cells in the hematopoietic microenvironment.
                                                                                                                             5. Answer: Stromal cells express homing receptors for hematopoietic cells and produce components of the extracellular matrix (fibronectin, hemonectin, collagen, etc); they synthesize and secrete cytokines for growth, differentiation, and negative regulation; they produce membrane-bound cytokines for juxtacrine signaling (e.g., SCF, FL, SCI) to hematopoietic precursor cells.
